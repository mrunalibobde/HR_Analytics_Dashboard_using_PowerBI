# -HR_Analytics_Dashboard_using_PowerBI
The HR Analytics project aims to leverage Power BI to gain valuable insights from the human resources data within an organization. The project will focus on analyzing various HR metrics, such as employee turnover, performance, recruitment effectiveness, and diversity, among others. By visualizing these key metrics, the HR team and stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to improve employee satisfaction, streamline processes, and optimize workforce management.

# Objective:
Help an organization improve employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating an HR Analytics dashboard.

#
I have used Bar charts, Donut charts, cards, Column charts, Area charts, and Slicers for filtering and visualizing the data.

- Column Chart: A chart that displays data as vertical bars, where the length of each bar represents the value of a category or measure.
- Donut Chart: Similar to a pie chart, but with a hole in the center, displaying the data in concentric rings.
- Bar Chart: Similar to a column chart, but the bars are displayed horizontally.
- Area Chart: A chart that shows the data as filled areas between the data points and the x-axis, useful for visualizing cumulative data.
- Treemap: A chart that displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with the size of each rectangle representing a data measure.
- Card: A simple visual that displays a single value or measure as a labeled card.
- Slicer: It is a powerful interactive visual element that allows users to filter and slice data in a report or dashboard.

# Final Insights:
1. Maximum attrition happening in the age group of 26 to 35.
2. Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role.
3. Maximum attrition after the lower rate of salary hike.
4. Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in the company.
5. Also average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab have higher chances of attrition.
